        <h2>calculator application</h2>

        <p>A simple calculator built with JavaScript, HTML, 
            and CSS. It performs basic arithmetic operations—addition, 
            subtraction, multiplication, and division—and features a 
            responsive design for use on various devices. This project
             showcases front-end development skills and progress made
              during self-study of JavaScript.
