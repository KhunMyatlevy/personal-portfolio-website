        <h2>Memory Card Game</h2>
        <p>A fun and interactive memory card game where players flip cards to find matching pairs.
             Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game tests the player's memory and improves
             focus. The cards flip dynamically, and the game tracks the player's progress until all 
             pairs are found.
        </p>
